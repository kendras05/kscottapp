				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>I have a certification in full stack development from UNLV through DevPoint Labs, received in April 2020.
						I am from San Bernardino, CA but I spent my teenage years in Las Vegas, NV. Both are home
						but I spent the majority of my 20s in Arizona where I earned a Bachelors in Psychology from Arizona
						State University. 
            
						I have worked in many industries such as a Digital Service specialist at Bank of America. I have also been
						the resident IT support for mental health agencies. I eventually combined both of my passions of helping
						people and technology when I worked as a Neurofeedback/Biofeedback Specialist for a plethora of mental
						health agecies in Las Vegas. I performed the therapy for clients while also installing, maintaining and teaching
						the employees on how to use both the software and hardware. 
						
						I am currently employed in the public sector working with the Clark County Government under the Department of
						Family Services.
